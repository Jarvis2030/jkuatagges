This is the Official AGGES website to be,still under production,a JKUAT Students based club where we meet either Physically(Mainly) or virtually.The main vision of this club is to expand the knowledge of the students on :Surveying,Geospatial Information Sciences, remote sensing, space technologies, work ethics and even individualistic social welbeing at large.
with our website, we will be in a position to share and reach out to a greater network.This will expand our access to more resources for our academic good.

This is a free and open source project(It only uses freely available products) that was started by an inspired member of the JKUAT AGGES students club.The idea to start this begun in November 2019.Then later escalated during the COVID-19 academic break.
We now call for intereste developers to come and collaborate and make this project a success.
